# Linear-Regression-of-CO2-Emissions-using-python
I have performed the linear regression model on the cases which I had formed from the CO2 Emissions data and got their r2 score with and without SGD regressor. Since my y_preds were equal to the test data, I have tuned the SGDRegressor parameters 'eta0' (learning rate) and 'max_iter' using Grid Search with penalty = None.
